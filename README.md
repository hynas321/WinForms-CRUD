# WinForms CRUD
## Description
A `Windows Forms` C# project that manipulates an XML file.
There are 4 types of operation:
- `add` - adds a new element with subelements that are put in the GroupBox
- `clear` - clears subelements from the GroupBox
- `save` - saves the current state of XML document
- `delete` - removes an element from an XML document

Namespace `System.Xml.Linq` is used to run all operations.\
Any XML file can be chosen from a disc, however it needs to have the same structure as `SampleFile.xml`.
